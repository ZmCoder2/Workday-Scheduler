# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a Work Day Scheduler web page I developed using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The main programming language that was used for this application was JavaScript. The web page is for a user that would like to put activities or "to do's" on a list depending on the time they wanted to do the activity at. 

At the top of the web page is the present date and time depending on where the user location is.

The time boxes go from 9am to 5pm for standard business hours. Depending on the time of the day the boxes will change to either gray for the past, red for the present, and green for the future. 

The users can put text into a time box of their choosing and click a save button that is displayed on the right side of each time box. Each time box has their own save button. When the user clicks the save button it saves to the local storage inside the console. When the user clicks the save button the text they wanted to save is supposed to save to the page so the user can go back when they have exited out (unfortunately I cannot figure out what is wrong with my last line of JavaScript code I had a Tutor look at it as well and couldn't figure it out either. I will be checking with a TA to resolve the issue and will resubmit if I figure out the problem.)
